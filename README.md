# Face detection using machine learning

Face detection is a core technology in computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI)
that involves identifying and locating human faces in digital images or video frames.
It's the initial step in many facial analysis applications, such as face recognition.

Face-detection algorithms focus on the detection of frontal human faces. It is analogous 
to image detection in which the image of a person is matched bit by bit. Image matches 
with the image stores in database. Any facial feature changes in the database will 
invalidate the matching process.

They can be taken even without the user’s knowledge and further can be used for security-based 
applications like criminal detection, face tracking, airport security, and forensic surveillance
systems. Face recognition involves capturing face images from a video or a surveillance camera.
They are compared with the stored database. Face recognition involves training known images, 
classifying them with known classes, and then they are stored in the database. When a test image 
is given to the system it is classified and compared with the stored database.
